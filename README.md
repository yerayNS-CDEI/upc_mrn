This is a ros2 package for the practices of the subject Mobile Robotics and Navigation (MRN) of the Master in Automation and Robotics (MUAR) of the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).

These practices are performed on Turtlebot4 lite platforms simulated and real.

# 1. Dependencies

For these practices you will need a PC with Ubuntu 22.04 and ros humble installed (ros-humble-desktop-full recommended).

Apart from ROS humble, the following dependencies are required for the practices. They all can be installed via apt:
- ssh
- git
- python3-colcon-common-extensions
- ignition-fortress
- ros-humble-rplidar-ros 
- ros-humble-rqt-tf-tree
- ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-simulator 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-desktop 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-navigation 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-node 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-tutorials

## 1.1. Setup script

For the students convenience, we provide an script to install the dependencies, configure a ros workspace (~/ros2_ws) and clone this package, in your personal laptop (Ubuntu 22.04 and ros humble required).
This script needs to be executed once. 

First, download the script:

```bash
wget --no-check-certificate -O mrn_setup.sh http://bit.ly/upc_mrn_laptop
```

Terminal output should say it downloaded the file successfully, otherwise, try again. 
Then, execute the script (your password will be required):

```bash
source mrn_setup.sh
```

Check that no errors occurred and then you can remove the script and the logs that were generated (rm mrn_setup.sh log_mrn_setup.log).

# 2. Example

## 2.1. Compile `upc_mrn`

To check that everything is working you need first to compile the upc_mrn package:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws && colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to upc_mrn
```

## 2.2. Simulation of turtlebot4 lite

And then, launch the simulation (gazebo ignition) of the Turtlebot4 lite (rgbd camera is not simulated for efficiency) in a room-like environment:

```bash
ros2 launch upc_mrn sim.launch.py world:=rooms gui:=false
```

**`sim.launch.py` arguments:**

- `gui`: Whether launch the gazebo GUI or not. (default: `true`)
- `world`: which world to load. Available: `empty`, `rooms`, `simple`, `large`, `small`. (default: `empty`)
- `x`, `y`, `yaw`: initial pose of the robot. (default: origin)
- `oak`: Whether a robot with the plugin of the OAK rbd camera or a robot without it. (default: `false`)

## 2.3. SLAM_toolbox

In this example we will run the `slam_toolbox` to create a map of the environment.
In another terminal, run the launch:

```bash
ros2 launch upc_mrn slam.launch.yaml
```

Then, the visualization (RVIZ2) in a third terminal:

```bash
rviz2 -d ~/ros2_ws/src/upc_mrn/rviz/slam.rviz
```

And finally, to move the robot, run the `teleop_twist_keyboard` node in a fourth terminal:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

## 2.4 Navigation

Instead of the teleoperation, we can launch the navigation (nav2) with a launch also provided:

```bash
ros2 launch upc_mrn nav.launch.yaml
```
