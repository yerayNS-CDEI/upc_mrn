This is a ros2 package for the practices of the subject Mobile Robotics and Navigation (MRN) of the Master in Automation and Robotics (MUAR) of the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).

These practices are performed on Turtlebot4 platforms simulated and real.

#Dependencies

For these practices you will need a PC with Ubuntu 22.04 and ros humble installed (ros-humble-desktop-full recommended).

Apart from ROS humble, the following dependencies are required for the practices. They all can be installed via apt:
- ssh
- git
- python3-colcon-common-extensions
- ignition-fortress
- ros-humble-rplidar-ros 
- ros-humble-rqt-tf-tree
- ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-simulator 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-desktop 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-navigation 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-node 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-tutorials

##Setup script

For the students convenience, we provide an script to install the dependencies, configure a ros workspace (~/ros2_ws) and clone this package, in your personal laptop (Ubuntu 22.04 and ros humble required).
This script needs to be executed once. 

1. Download the script:

`wget --no-check-certificate -O mrn_setup.sh http://bit.ly/upc_mrn_laptop`

Terminal output should say it downloaded the file successfully, otherwise, try again. 

2. Then, execute the script (your password will be required):

`source mrn_setup.sh`

Check that no errors occurred and then you can remove the script and the logs that were generated (rm mrn_setup.sh log_mrn_setup.log).
